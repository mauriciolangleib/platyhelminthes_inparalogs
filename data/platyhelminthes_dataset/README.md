# Additional data
Sequences were renamed following an internal code. Only the longest isoforms were considered for subsequent analyses.
Proteomes named with 'WBPS9' are indeed equal to those of version 11 of WormBase ParaSite, and were consequently not updated from an older version of this paper whre WBPS9 was used instead of WBPS11.
